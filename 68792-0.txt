ACKNOWLEDGEMENT


The publishers and editors of the Cross Word Puzzle Books wish to
record the debt of all Cross Word fans to The New York World for its
pioneer work in the field. Cross Word Puzzles have been run in the
Sunday World for over twenty years and their present nation-wide vogue
had its origin in and received its greatest impetus from the Puzzle
Page of the Sunday World Magazine. The fifty cross word puzzles in this
book are all entirely new and have never been printed before in any
publication.









OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT


The original Cross Word Puzzle Books, published by Simon and Schuster,
are the only ones officially endorsed by the Amateur Cross Word Puzzle
League of America and edited in conformity with the rules of cross word
puzzle construction promulgated by the League and printed on page 9 of
this book.









PREFACE


Controversy, which is the breath of life to any of the arts or
sciences, has reared its head among the ranks of Cross Word solvers.
The air is filled with ’tis and ’tain’t. The clan is divided into
schools, which is well for the vitality of puzzling. It is undoubtedly
true that a house divided against itself cannot stand; but it is also
veritable that an art divided against itself flourisheth exceedingly.

The schism that is causing all the noise, reduced to its simplest
terms, is stated in the question, “Shall the Cross Word Puzzle be made
hard or easy?”

On the one hand stand the pundits, with thesaurus and dictionary armed.
They crave queer words and exotic definitions. They thrill to the
cross-clue unravelling of some strange combination of vowels and
consonants resembling nothing ever uttered by human tongue, but which
their reference-books declare is a genuine word, with meanings and
inflections and everything. They delight in extracting a simple word
from its definition of secondary or tertiary meaning: when “express
generally” is solved as “air” they greet the word so often defined as
“mixture of gases” with cries of delight; “introduce as an antagonist”
is found to be “pit,” and tears of joy are shed over the relief from
the common “hole” or “depression.”

Thus the solvers who revel in the recondite. Opposed to them stand the
serried ranks of those whose pleasure lies in the accomplishment; who
do not wish their onward march to victory delayed by forests of
Javanese shrubs or oceans full of rajidae with enlarged pectoral fins.
Nor do they wish words torn far from their daily, or at least
semi-weekly, use. A Leer by the river’s brim a simple Sly Glance is to
them, and not an Annealing-furnace.

A third element enters the lists at this point—the constructors. When a
man has a superb puzzle almost finished, with complete interlock and no
abbreviations or unkeyed letters, he frequently finds a space left into
which nothing will go except a particularly rare combination of
letters—let us say, for example, TIL. The constructor runs hastily
through his vocabulary and finds no TIL; he has a vague recollection of
such a word somewhere in his poetic remembrances; but the familiar
abbreviation of “until” is “till,” and the constructor has no wish to
add the damning parenthesis-enclosed “poet. contr.” after his
definition. He tries all the combinations possible; none will fit. Torn
between despair and hope he seeks Webster’s Unabridged. Trembling
finger runs down the columns. Ah! Between “tikur” and “tilbury,” in
small type, as though ashamed of existence, he finds what he seeks.
“Til—Sesame.” Into the construction goes the word, and the puzzle is
finished. Observe that the constructor had no desire to introduce this
exotic syllable; he did not even know that there was such a word in any
language. If he could have written “tic,” or “tie,” or “tin,” or “tip,”
or “tis,” or “tit,” he would have done so. But “til” was his sole
refuge, and the Unabridged bore him nobly out. Thus, says the
constructor, why should the solver rage when he discovers “sesame”
among the definitions? Let him try to make one himself, etc., etc.

Returning a moment to the pundits’ side of the argument, observe a
fact. If any solver had been asked, before he took up cross words, to
give offhand the name of Egypt’s sun-god, a three-letter word meaning
island, a four-letter word for handbag, the name of a large Australian
bird, or the sash affected by the ladies of cherry-blossom land, it is
odds but that he would have been reduced to stammering evasions. But
even a tyro at the glorious game can now rattle off by rote the words
Ra, Uit, Etui, Moa, Obi. In running down the definitions of a new
puzzle it is not the household words that set him scribbling
frantically, but such old friends as the above. So, contend the
punditti, a word that may be a nameless horror at the moment becomes
through association a friend in time of trouble.

True enough, answer the believers in the simplicities, but the
introduction of such words is evidence of laziness on the part of the
constructor. Moreover, their constant use tends to eliminate them,
their places to be taken by other literal monstrosities. And there is
much in this contention. Where now are the Emu and the Eel? Time was,
and not so long ago, that every other construction was the combined
aviary and aquarium necessary to harbor these two; today they are one
with Nineveh and Tyre. And so it may well be with Ra and Uit and Etui.
They will march one by one into the shades where lurk the other gallant
words that died of over-work. And the strange combinations that take
their places will also abide their little hour, and go their way.

Once again the constructor beats on the table and demands to be heard.
“Where,” he asks, “do I get off? Am I to be barred from including words
that finish my design because a group of you insist that no word not
included in everyday vocabularies appear in the little white squares?
Or am I to suffer under the lash of scorn because a few of you mock my
brilliant construction wherein no exotic letter-combination rears its
head?—a construction that cost me more time than if I had allowed a few
oddities, I may add. What am I to do?”

“Go as far as you like!” cry the Recondites.

“Stick to the common words!” insist the Champions of the Plain.

Of course, these admonitions do not help the constructor in the least.
He is the ham in the verbal sandwich—necessary, but spread rather thin
and squashed flat. It is in the nature of things that this should be
so. No creator has had a different experience. You can please some of
the people, and the rest of it. It is part of the penalty of the
builder to receive criticism. Scarce have the birth-pangs passed when
the child is the storm-center of a tempest of contradictory comment.

It is, of course, an indeterminable debate. The Simplicities have their
case, as have the Abstrusities. In the meantime, short of erasure and
complete rebirth, the constructor’s pattern remains. For better, for
worse, for easier, for harder, in the pocket edition or the Unabridged,
his words cross and twine all among the blacks and the whites.

In the meantime, the schism remains. What is to come of it, we know
not. Whatever the decision may be, the constructor will not change his
status. Once a constructor, always between the millstones.

            Once from the world I sought surcease
              Between a novel’s covers pressed;
            No longer there I look for peace;
              Of anodynes I’ve found the best.
              So, when the sun sinks in the west
            Sunk, too, are husband, friends and cook—
              Where do I find my treasure chest?

              A caller intrudes? Hein? Kill ze pest!
              Oh, Noah Webster, you are blest

              What is the Welsh for “eagle’s nest”?
            What is a Flemish tartan crease?
              Who was it asked the Erse for “breast”?
              Who can define a Baltic jest?
            Who ever called it a six-pronged hook!
              You will discern them, mixed and messed,
            All in the leaves of the Cross Word Book.

            L’envoi

VOCABULARY ENRICHMENT IN THE SUBURBS DUE TO THE CROSS WORD PUZZLE
INFLUENCE


(Two neighbors, Mrs. Wordsworth and Mrs. Frazee, are spending a warm
summer afternoon together on the former’s front porch. They are
sewing.)

Mrs. W.—What is that you are working at, my dear?

Mrs. F.—I’m tatting Joe’s initials on his moreen vest. Are you making
that ebon garment for yourself?

Mrs. W.—Yea. Just a black dress for every day. Henry says I look rather
naif in black.

Mrs. F.—Well, perhaps; but it’s a bit too anile for me. Give me
something in indigo or, say, ecru.

Mrs. W.—Quite right. There is really no neb in such solemn investments.

Mrs. F.—Stet.

Mrs. W.—By the way, didn’t I hear that your little Junior met with an
accident?

Mrs. F.—Yes. The little oaf fell from an apse and fractured his artus.

Mrs. W.—Egad!

Mrs. F.—And to make matters worse Dr. Bloop botched it so that we had
to trek into town to a specialist. How Dr. Bloop makes his sal is a
rebus to me.

Mrs. W.—The zany.

Mrs. F.—Joe’s ire was so aroused that he told Dr. Bloop right to his
visage that he was a dolt and an ort. Is your offspring well?

Mrs. W.—Not entirely. He was abed yester with a severe megrim, dark
arcs neath his orbs and as pale as talc.

Mrs. F.—Renal?

Mrs. W.—That is moot. You see, Dicky is so active.

Mrs. F.—A perfect icon of his pater; restless as a little emu.

Mrs. W.—He took a canoe out on the tarn and paddled over to the ait.
There he stepped into a fen and got his feet roric.

Mrs. F.—Boys have such an elan for the eau.

Mrs. W.—Why can’t they play on the muirs and in the wald nearby? I gave
him a drachm of ricin and thank goodness he was better this morn.

Mrs. F.—I’m so glad. This torrid weather is very trying. One’s vitality
reaches its nadir in this heat, and to add to the discomfort I have an
incompetent serf to contend with.

Mrs. W.—Oh, this esne problem. The last one I had was such a schelm I
had to let her go. Would you drink a nice cold beaker of negus? I’m so
sere.

Mrs. F.—Don’t trouble yourself, my dear.

Mrs. W.—Not at all. It’s Henry’s favorite quaff and he insists upon it
being on the ice at all times. He gets quite roiled if it isn’t.

Mrs. F.—Well, we must humor our sires. I hate to hear them gnar.

(They are interrupted by piercing juvenile shrieks growing rapidly
louder and nearer. Junior and Dicky, ages six and seven, burst into
view around the corner of the house. They take final kicks at each
other before smothering their sobs in the laps of their respective
mothers.)

Mrs. F.—Why, Junior, what is this?

Mrs. W.—Come, come, Dicky, aren’t you ashamed of such——

Dicky (Howling)—W-well, it’s h-his fault. He said I was a five-letter
word meaning a human being with inferior intelligence and wit!

Junior—And he called me a four-letter word meaning an invisible
particle of matter!

Dicky—And that’s what you are.

(They mix it up once more and are disentangled with difficulty.)

Mrs. F.—I think we had better be going, Mrs. Wordsworth. I’m so sorry.

Mrs. W.—Male progeny will be male progeny, you know.

(Mrs. F. drags Junior away.)

Dicky—(Yelling after him with much feeling)—ATOM!!

Junior—(Not too gently)—MORON!!!

RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF CROSS WORD PUZZLES

Reported by the Committee on Rules, and adopted by The Amateur Cross
Word Puzzle League of America at its meeting, September 27, 1924, in
The Wanamaker Auditorium, New York City.


1. Pattern

    The pattern shall interlock all over.
    Only approximately one-sixth of the squares shall be black.
    Only approximately one-tenth of the letters shall be unkeyed.
    The design shall be symmetrical.

2. Words

    Obsolete, and dialectic words may be used in moderation, if plainly
    marked and accessible in some standard dictionary, such as
    Webster’s New International (Merriam’s), Funk & Wagnalls’ and
    Century.
    Foreign words that are more or less familiar and are easily
    accessible, may be used, but should be marked with the language to
    which they belong.
    Technical terms that are found in a standard dictionary may be
    used.
    Abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes, should be avoided as far as
    possible. When used they should be plainly marked and must be
    legitimate.

3. Definitions

    Great variety may be attained in writing the definitions and as
    wide a scope as possible must be left to the constructor. The only
    requirement is common sense. This means that the definitions may be
    of the safe and sane dictionary kind, may be literary or
    historical, may employ secondary meanings cleverly, may be
    legitimately funny. Synonyms that are too far removed from the word
    and what Gelett Burgess calls “smarty-cat definitions” should be
    avoided.









HOW TO SOLVE A CROSS WORD PUZZLE


There are two essential points that must be remembered by initiates
into the cross word puzzlers’ fraternity. First, the numbers in the
squares refer to the definitions; secondly, there should be but one
letter to each white square.

Figure 1 shows a cross word puzzle challenging each and every one of us
to solve it. Looking the puzzle over we find that 1 horizontal calls
for a seven letter word meaning “disparage.” That is not so easy, so we
leave it temporarily. We go on to the next one, which is a three letter
word meaning “a cereal grass.” What else could it be but OAT? Therefore
we ink in OAT in the proper squares. “Vice Admiral.” That most
assuredly must be VA. We place that into position. The ninth, tenth and
eleventh do not come to our minds immediately, so we pass them up. We
will catch them on the cross check. Twelve is familiar, however, and
with a little thought we place LO in the vacant squares. The rest do
not come to us, so we leave them also, and turn to the verticals.

Looking over the diagram (See Figure 2) we find that one vertical calls
for a seven letter word whose third and fifth letters are V and L
respectively and which is defined as “evolve.” The V and the L give us
the clue. The word is DEVELOP. We place it in the diagram. Two, three
and four are easy, for we have three clues to work on and we find the
proper words without much difficulty. The next one is beyond us, so we
go on to the one numbered 8. We find that a three letter word—starting
with A—meaning “gone by,” is needed. The clues of A and O enable us to
get that without much trouble, and we place AGO in the square. We pass
by nine, but thirteen is easy. “A male sheep?” Why, of course, the word
is RAM.

From now on the going is easy. We have plenty of clues to the words
that we do not know. (See Figure 3.) Rechecking the horizontals, we
find that we have the first, third, fourth and fifth letters of
“disparage,” and with their aid we easily see that the word is DETRACT.
Looking for a two letter word meaning “an edge-tool,” we soon find that
there is but one word that will fit. We place AX in position. With nine
vertical beginning with an A it is easy to find that ARE is the proper
word. Ten horizontal proves to be EGG and eleven becomes ART. We say to
ourselves that if we could only get five vertical we would have the
puzzle solved. Well, why not? Is the second letter an a, e, i, o, or u?
The definition gives it as “a web.” What word will fit but TEXTURE? We
place that into position. Now, we find that we have the puzzle almost
completed. Fifteen horizontal needs a three letter word meaning
“impair.” Its middle letter must be an A. With the A to guide us that
is simple. The word is “SAP.” Fifteen and sixteen being two letter
words are easily found, and we place SO and PI into position. We now
find that we have the puzzle completed with one exception. Seventeen
horizontal has to be found. Its first, third, fourth, fifth and seventh
letters are P OMI E. A consonant is needed for the second letter, and R
seems to be the most logical choice. That gives us the word, which is
defined as “agreement.” (See Figure 4.)

We settle back into our chair with a sigh of content at the thought of
a job well done. But that is not the finish. Rather it is but the
start. Now that we have tasted the pleasures of cross word puzzling, we
are loath to give our time to anything else. What other amusement
offers the pleasure, instruction and satisfaction that is to be found
in Cross Word Puzzles? There is but one answer to that question,
and—foregoing the movies—we settle down to the elusive task of tracking
words to their lairs.









DO’S AND DON’T’S FOR SOLVERS


Don’t get scared if you can’t guess the first horizontal word. Go
through the list till you find a definition that you’re sure of. That
is the simplest method of beginning the solution. When you have written
in all the words you are sure of, you will have plenty of clues for the
unknowns.

Don’t spend too much time with the long words unless you are sure of
them. They will appear when the short ones have been solved. Of course,
not all the short ones are easy, but they are generally more readily
attended to than the long ones. Also, there are more of them,
increasing the chances of finding familiar faces among the definitions.

If you think a word is right, pencil it in lightly till you are sure.
This saves erosion of paper and temper. But never hesitate to try a
word that may be right. The trial and error method holds in puzzling as
it does in life.

Remember that the horizontals furnish a sure check on the verticals,
and vice versa.

If you are hopelessly stuck, try another puzzle. Inspiration sometimes
waits for a return engagement.

A pleasant feeling of something attempted, something done, accompanies
the solution of a cross word puzzle. It’s good for the inferiority
complex.









PUZZLE NO. 101

A CHRISTMAS TREE

By Moby Dick


This Christmas tree is a tour de force in consecutive two-letter words.
Even the veriest beginner should finish it in a half hour, for the
words are all fair and should come to mind immediately. This is a case
where the rule on ratio of black squares to white is purposely violated
for appropriateness of design.

PUZZLE NO. 121

A ROSE WITH A THORN OR TWO

By Alfred A. Wicklund


Conscience compels the editors to warn the solver of several troublous
words lying unobtrusively among a collection of pleasant and easily
diverting ones. But that is the delight of cross word puzzling. The
solver likes a little pain mixed with his pleasure.

PUZZLE NO. 122

NINE CROSSES

By Madge Sweeney


Fine masses of words, but not too difficult. A few unkeyed letters.
Most puzzlers complain about them, and we don’t blame them. At the same
time, it is good dictionary practise to hunt along among the “pal”s
until you come to “pali.”

PUZZLE NO. 129

BEDIAMONDED BEAUTY

By P. R. Brown


This diamond studded puzzle is truly a gem. It should prove only
moderately difficult, for all its pretty designs. (You know, of course,
that a handsome design often leads the builder into difficulties from
which he escapes by resort to some musty word concealed in the depths
of the dictionary.)

PUZZLE NO. 130

FOR INSOMNIACS

By Dennis R. Smith


We are told that puzzles put people to sleep and prevent nervous
breakdowns by taking the subject’s mind off his troubles. This one
should have therapeutic qualities, for according to the ratio rule it
could have at least 38 black squares, whereas it has only 33.

Doesn’t this look easy, a simple little pattern that seems certain to
be filled with such words as “dog” and “cat?” The editors did not want
the solver to have the shock of picking this one as a light ten
minutes, and then find himself involved in tormenting perplexities.

get motheaten. We’ll say he does his best to prevent any such

CRUTCHES AND CROSSES

By Knacker


Here’s a stiff one, with enough mythology and history in it to keep

PUZZLE NO. 141

WORDS AND MUSIC

By Mr. and Mrs. Ottokar T. Cadek


Mr. Cadek is quite a figure in that field of music where the string
quartette raises its austere voice. But no feat of counterpoint is more
difficult than the placing against each other of two long words such as
in 19 and 26 Horizontal or 72 and 78 Horizontal.

PUZZLE NO. 143

A MILITARY SALUTE

Incidentally, is there anything finer than the way difficulties

PUZZLE NO. 147

NOT A FLIVVER

By Frank A. Ford

recondite. And, if you are inclined to call Mr. Ford a Master of
Unkeyed Letters—well, just try your hand at constructing a twenty-one
square puzzle.

PUZZLE NO. 150

AN INDENTED TERROR

By J. T. Delaney


“With such friends one does not need enemies,” an old proverb goes. Mr.
Delaney is a familiar friend to followers of The Cross Word Puzzle
Books, but the editors will bet that many a one has said that his worst
enemy could not have given him more cold sweats.

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
